Forwarding is currently configured as follows:

- On a DNS level, "oss-review-toolkit.org" forwards to "oss-review-toolkit.github.io".
- On a HTML level, "oss-review-toolkit.github.io" forwards to "https://oss-review-toolkit.org/ort".
- So effectively, "oss-review-toolkit.org" (both HTTP and HTTPS) forwards to "https://oss-review-toolkit.org/ort".
